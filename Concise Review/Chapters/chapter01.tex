\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Basic Mathematical Models}
In this concise review we will provide brief explanations to the core concepts of differential equations, and include some examples to show the many techniques used in differential equations. Refer to the scratch paper if further examples and procedures are needed. For future reference the textbook used is "Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems" by William E. Boyce and Richard C. DiPrima. All the graphics used in this document were created by Tarang Srivastava in Wolfram Mathematica \\

Equations considering derivatives are \textbf{differential equations}. A differential equation that describes a physical process is a \textbf{mathematical model}. \\
A model for an object falling in earth's atmosphere may be given by the differential equation $m \frac{dv}{dt} = mg - \gamma v$. Moving things around we get $\frac{dv}{dt} = 9.8 - \frac{v}{5}$ There are several solutions for this equation and can be represented by the slope field. \\
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=7cm]{f1}
	$$\frac{dv}{dt} = 9.8 - \frac{v}{5}$$
\end{center}
The line $y=49$ shows the equilibrium solution for this case\\
\section{Solutions of Differential Equations}
When a problem is given where there are infinite solutions, usually when there is a constant in the solution as a result of integration, an \textbf{initial condition} can be set to find a particular answer, this is called an \textbf{initial value probelm}. A general example of this is
\begin{align*}
\dfrac{dy}{dt} = ay - b \\
y(0) = y_0 \\
\frac{dy/dt}{y-(b/a)} = a\\
\ln{ \vline y-(b/a) \vline} = at + C && \text{Where C is an arbitrary constant}\\ 
y = b/a + ce^{at} && \text{solve for C using the initial condition}\\
y = b/a + (y_0 - b/a)e^{at}
\end{align*}
The \textbf{general solution} with the constant gives all possible solutions, and graphs the \textbf{integral curves}

$$v = 49 + ce^{-t/5}$$
\section{Classification of Differential Equations}
Differential equations are classified into \textbf{ordinary differential equations} and \textbf{partial differential equations}. ODE have ordinary derivatives whereas PDE have partial derivatives. The \textbf{order} is the highest derivative. There are linear and nonlinear functions, we will mostly deal with linear for now.
